#  Cat9 - correlation of cat events
#  
#  Written by Robert Day CISSP 9/21/2014
#
#   Device file : basis.conf 
#
#   function : Using fuzzy logic to determine correlation of events based on device 
#   significance, designated level of device, known returns of application.
#   Analogy : a water meter in line to your home is built to expect water pressure at 
#   55 PSI. If the pressure is suddenly changed to 10,000 PSI, the water meter breaks, 
#   allowing the water to spill out. Nothing is lost within your home. If the water meter
#   holds, then other flex lines break spilling water and damaging your home.
